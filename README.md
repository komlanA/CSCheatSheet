## Overview
### Description
This application is to help Computer Science students by providing them with a single resource for them to study and learn about important concepts, common languages, algorithms, data structures, etc.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Educational
- **Mobile:** A website is view only, app will allow users to use camera for posting pictures of notes or important information.
- **Story:** Allows students to work together and share helpful information which will make learning a more communal experience. 
- **Market:** Anyone who is studying computer science or a related field, or just somebody who is interested in the subject. 
- **Habit:** Users can post any new information, but there will be a vote and discussion system on new posts and how reliable or correct the information is. The app will also be populated by posts from the developer.
- **Scope:** The CS Cheat Sheet app will start out as just an app to help study Computer Science along with a forum for discussion. It could later grow to include other areas of study, and maybe live chat rooms to discuss topics and learn from eachother.

        query.whereEqualTo(Post.KEY_USER, ParseUser.getCurrentUser());
        query.findInBackground(new FindCallback<Post>() {
            @Override
            public void done(List<Post> posts, ParseException e) {

      - (Create/POST) Create a new post object
        ```swift
        // Specify which class to query
        ParseQuery<Post> query = ParseQuery.getQuery(Post.class);
        query.include(Post.KEY_USER);
        query.findInBackground(new FindCallback<Post>() {
            @Override

        ```
      - (POST) Cast down vote
        ```swift
